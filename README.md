# flutter_provider_bloc_example
Hello!<br>
This is for beginners who are starting to study 'Provider', 'Bloc pattern'<br>
플러터 초보자를 위한, Provider사용법과 Bloc패턴 예제입니다.
<br><br><br>
<h2> FirstScreen </h2>
The simple counter screen using provider
<br>
<h2> SecondScreen </h2>
The MultiProvider example
<br>
<h2> ThirdScreen </h2>
The Listview using provider
<br>
<h2> FourthScreen </h2>
The Listview using Rxdart, Stream<br>
I wanted to make loading indicator using just one stream(list stream), but i couldn't do that.<br>
if use 'ConnectionState.done', it must close the stream. but, opening and closing stream frequently is not efficient.<br>
if there is a good way please let me know.<br>
Thanks.
